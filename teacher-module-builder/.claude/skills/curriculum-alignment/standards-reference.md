   Causality is tested through investigation.
3. **Scale, Proportion, and Quantity** -- Phenomena observed at various scales can be
   understood using models and mathematical representations.
4. **Systems and System Models** -- Defining boundaries and making models helps understand
   and predict system behavior.
5. **Energy and Matter** -- Tracking flows of energy and matter into, out of, and within
   systems helps understand system possibilities and limitations.
6. **Structure and Function** -- The shape and stability of structures determines function.
